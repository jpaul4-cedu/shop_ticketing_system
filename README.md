# shop_ticketing_system

This ticketing system makes use of Excel's VBA functionality (macros) to run a complete ticketing system.

When I first joined the University of Alabama Outdoor Recreation Bike Shop, we were using paper tickets to track our bikes as they progressed through the work process, but something as simple as losing a ticket led us to no longer being able to contact the bikes owner. I decided to create this system utilizing the skillset I had at the time. This, coupled with the limitations both in cost and from an IT systems perspective, made VBA a natural choice.

The system runs by utilzing the excel file on both the shop computer, and the welcome desk computer. When someone brings in a bike for repairs, a ticket is created by the counter staff member, and it automatically emails the details of the ticket to the customer. Additionally, it utilizes the receipt printer to print out a number to attach to the bike for tracking. This data is passed between the computers utilizing the internal filesharing drive at the University.

Tickets can be updated including standard prices for common jobs with pickup notifications sent upon completetion. 

Although some would argue that VBA is not the right tool for this job, the system has been succesfully deployed for 6 complete years. Its insensitivity to updates due to Excels long term stability has made it very reliable. The only reason the system is going to be replaced is because my younger brother happens to also attend the University of Alabama, and work in the Outdoor Rec Shop, and is a CS major in need of a final project. He will be recreating the system in a more purpose suitable framework.
